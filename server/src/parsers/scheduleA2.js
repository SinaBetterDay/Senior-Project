/**
 * Schedule A-2 — Investments, income and assets of business entities / trusts
 * in which the filer holds a business position.
 *
 * Pure parser: `parseScheduleA2(buffer, filingId)` returns snake_case rows for
 * `schedule_a2_business_positions` and performs no DB writes. Returns [] when
 * the workbook cannot be read or has no A-2 sheet.
 *
 * Column mapping (see docs/fair/form700-ingestion/CONTEXT.md):
 *   entity_name          ← NAME OF BUSINESS ENTITY OR TRUST
 *   business_position    ← YOUR BUSINESS POSITION
 *   fair_market_value    ← FAIR MARKET VALUE (first / entity-level column)
 *   nature_of_investment ← NATURE OF INVESTMENT
 *   gross_income_range   ← INCLUDE YOUR PRO RATA SHARE OF GROSS INCOME TO ENTITY/TRUST
